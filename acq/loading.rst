Grid Preparation
================

Clipping Autogrids
------------------

Prepare the following utensils prior to clipping:

1. blue clipping station with lid
2. c clips
3. c clip rings
4. 6x clipping tools
5. tweezers
6. auto grid tweezers
7. nano cap
8. dewar with liquid nitrogen
9. warm up heater to 80C


Prepare the clipping station:

1. add the c clip rings
2. add the auto grid boxes
3. screw in the lids of the auto grid boxes

Load the clipping tool with c clip:

1. With a pair of tweezers, take up a c clip from its center.
2. Gently insert it into the clipping tool.
3. Puch the sides of the c clip to the clipping tool wall.
4. Gently puch the clipping tool onto the filter paper .
5. Check top of the clipping tool to locate the c clip.


Close the clipping station and fill with liquid N2 so that your grid boxes and sample is covered. 

.. warning::


          Do not fill liquid N2 above the sample, as this might cause the grid squares to break.


Once the clipping station is cool, do the following:

1. Transfer your grid boxes from the ethan container or from your storage puck.
2. Open your grid boxes.
3. Place a c clip ring with flat side down onto the clipping site.
4. With a pair of tweezers, gently take out a grid from the storage grid box and transfer in onto your c clip ring.
5. With the auto grid tweezers, rotate the golden part of the clipping station.
6. Use the loaded clipping tool and place it on top of your grid.
7. Gently push the clipping tool until you here a gentle clicking sound.
8. Remove the clipping tool and check if the c clip is still on the tool or on the grid.
9. To double check if the c clip is tight you can rotate the autogrid with the auto grid tweezers.
10. Insert the clipped autogrid into the auto grid box, starting from position 1. C clips face towords the front of the box.

Preparing Nanocap
-----------------


1. Gently pour liquid N2 into the nanocup, try not to spill liquid N2 on the sides
2. Firmly press lid for about 10s, wait
3. Top up with liquid N2, press lid again
4. The nanocap is ready when their is no bubbling of liquid N2 anymore
