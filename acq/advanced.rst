Condenser Astigmatism
---------------------

Do the following in order to check if there is condenser astigmatism:

1. Set data acquisition magnification, eucentric height, in focus
2. Insert screen
3. centre beam with beam shift
4. Condense beam (adjust intensity)
5. Go few times through the cross-over to check that it remains circular.

If the beam does not expand circularly, remove the C2 astigmatism as follows:

1. select the Stigmator tab > condenser. There are three sets of numbers (see image below). Box around selected set. Can save by right click & copy.
2. Adjust condenser astigmatism with XY multifunction knobs.
3. Keep going up & down on intensity to get cross-over & check beam shape.
4. When the beam stays circular going though the cross-over, click 'None' (means no astigmatism).

Condenser Aperture
------------------

Do the following in order to check that the condenser aperture is centred using the flu screen.
1. Condense the beam and center it with the trackball.
2. Expand the beam with the intensity knob (clockwise) and make sure that it expands symmetrically (repeat expanding the beam also anticlockwise). 
3. The beam has to expand symmetrically both ways for the C2 aperture to be centered. 
4. If the aperture is not centered go to the Aperture tab, click on Condenser > adjust and center it with multifunction X and Y.
5. Once done click adjust again.

.. _advanced-microscopy-beam-tilt-pivot-points:

Beam Tilt Pivot Points
----------------------

Do the following in order to align the beam tilt pivot points.

1. Insert screen.
2. Condense the beam to a little circle (alternatively you could also decrease the magnification). 
3. In Direct alignments, press Beam tilt-pp X. 
4. Minimise the movement of the beam tilt pivot points using multifunction x (y is not active). 
5. Repeat the same for Beam tilt pp Y.
6. Press done.
7. Retract screen.


.. _advanced-microscopy-centre-objective-aperture:

Objective Aperture centering
----------------------------

Do the following in order to centre the objective aperture.

1. Set data acquisition presets.
2. Press 'Diffraction' on the control panel.
3. Adjust the intensity of the flu-screen so that you see both the direct beam and the aperture disk.
4. Go to the Aperture tab and select the desired objective aperture.
5. Click on 'Adjust' and centre the aperture disk onto the direct beam using multifunction x&y.
6. Click 'Adjust'. 
7. Press 'Diffraction' again.
8. Answer EPU question with 'Yes'.


.. _advanced-microscopy-autocoma:

Autocoma
--------

1. Set data acquisition mag.
2. Go to the auto-functions panel in EPU.
3. Sselect autofunctions-TEM,  Autocoma, preset Thon Ring
4. Press Start.
